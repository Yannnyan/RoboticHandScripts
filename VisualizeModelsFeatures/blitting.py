==================================
Faster rendering by using blitting
==================================

*Blitting* is a `standard technique
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit>`__ in raster graphics that,
in the context of Matplotlib, can be used to (drastically) improve
performance of interactive figures. For example, the
:mod:`.animation` and :mod:`.widgets` modules use blitting
internally. Here, we demonstrate how to implement your own blitting, outside
of these classes.

Blitting speeds up repetitive drawing by rendering all non-changing
graphic elements into a background image once. Then, for every draw, only the
changing elements need to be drawn onto this background. For example,
if the limits of an Axes have not changed, we can render the empty Axes
including all ticks and labels once, and only draw the changing data later.

The strategy is

- Prepare the constant background:

  - Draw the figure, but exclude all artists that you want to animate by
    marking them as *animated* (see `.Artist.set_animated`).
  - Save a copy of the RBGA buffer.

- Render the individual images:

  - Restore the copy of the RGBA buffer.
  - Redraw the animated artists using `.Axes.draw_artist` /
    `.Figure.draw_artist`.
  - Show the resulting image on the screen.

One consequence of this procedure is that your animated artists are always
drawn on top of the static artists.

Not all backends support blitting.  You can check if a given canvas does via
the `.FigureCanvasBase.supports_blit` property.

.. warning::

   This code does not work with the OSX backend (but does work with other
   GUI backends on Mac).

Minimal example
---------------

We can use the `.FigureCanvasAgg` methods
`~.FigureCanvasAgg.copy_from_bbox` and
`~.FigureCanvasAgg.restore_region` in conjunction with setting
``animated=True`` on our artist to implement a minimal example that
uses blitting to accelerate rendering

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# animated=True tells matplotlib to only draw the artist when we
# explicitly request it
(ln,) = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), animated=True)

# make sure the window is raised, but the script keeps going
plt.show(block=False)

# stop to admire our empty window axes and ensure it is rendered at
# least once.
#
# We need to fully draw the figure at its final size on the screen
# before we continue on so that :
#  a) we have the correctly sized and drawn background to grab
#  b) we have a cached renderer so that ``ax.draw_artist`` works
# so we spin the event loop to let the backend process any pending operations
plt.pause(0.1)

# get copy of entire figure (everything inside fig.bbox) sans animated artist
bg = fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(fig.bbox)
# draw the animated artist, this uses a cached renderer
ax.draw_artist(ln)
# show the result to the screen, this pushes the updated RGBA buffer from the
# renderer to the GUI framework so you can see it
fig.canvas.blit(fig.bbox)

for j in range(100):
    # reset the background back in the canvas state, screen unchanged
    fig.canvas.restore_region(bg)
    # update the artist, neither the canvas state nor the screen have changed
    ln.set_ydata(np.sin(x + (j / 100) * np.pi))
    # re-render the artist, updating the canvas state, but not the screen
    ax.draw_artist(ln)
    # copy the image to the GUI state, but screen might not be changed yet
    fig.canvas.blit(fig.bbox)
    # flush any pending GUI events, re-painting the screen if needed
    fig.canvas.flush_events()
    # you can put a pause in if you want to slow things down
    # plt.pause(.1)

###############################################################################
# This example works and shows a simple animation, however because we
# are only grabbing the background once, if the size of the figure in
# pixels changes (due to either the size or dpi of the figure
# changing) , the background will be invalid and result in incorrect
# (but sometimes cool looking!) images.  There is also a global
# variable and a fair amount of boilerplate which suggests we should
# wrap this in a class.
#
# Class-based example
# -------------------
#
# We can use a class to encapsulate the boilerplate logic and state of
# restoring the background, drawing the artists, and then blitting the
# result to the screen.  Additionally, we can use the ``'draw_event'``
# callback to capture a new background whenever a full re-draw
# happens to handle resizes correctly.
